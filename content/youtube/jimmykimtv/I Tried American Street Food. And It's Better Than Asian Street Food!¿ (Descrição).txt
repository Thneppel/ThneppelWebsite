In this video, I’m heading to Downtown L.A. to check out Smorgasburg, a popular weekly flea market and food event where you can find some of the best street food in the city! These days, it’s one of the few places in L.A. where dozens of street food vendors gather in one spot, offering an incredible variety of cuisines.

From American-style BBQ and lobster rolls to Mexican delicacies and Korean street food, there’s something for everyone. I had an amazing time exploring the market and tasting some truly delicious dishes. So, is Smorgasburg worth the hype? Watch the video to find out!
