In this video, I visited an all-you-can-eat Korean BBQ restaurant in New York that costs $159 per person. The restaurant offers A5 Wagyu beef (though not Korean Hanwoo) alongside an impressive selection of side dishes. As far as I know, this is the most expensive all-you-can-eat Korean BBQ restaurant in the United States. So, what makes it so pricey, and is the food worth it? Watch the video to find out!
