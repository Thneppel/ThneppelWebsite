I am Thiago Wagner Neppel, a designer and creative director with over 8 years of experience in graphic design, branding, and audiovisual production. I work across visual identity, advertising campaigns, digital content, and full audiovisual projects, from concept to final delivery.

Throughout my career, I have worked with agencies, print shops, startups, and independent projects, developing a strategic mindset that connects aesthetics, communication, and results. I have strong proficiency with the Adobe Creative Suite and solid experience in art direction, motion design, video editing, photography, and creative management.

I am currently the founder and marketing director of [Matka Studios](http://matkastudios.com), a studio focused on game development and publishing, where I apply marketing strategies tailored to the gaming industry, combining creativity, brand positioning, and audience analysis.

My focus is on creating consistent, functional, and visually strong projects, always aligning identity, narrative, and purpose. I continuously seek growth by exploring new media, technologies, and formats, especially at the intersection of design, audiovisual, and games.
