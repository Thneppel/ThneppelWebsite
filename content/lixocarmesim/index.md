### Stop-Motion Short Film

This project is a **stop-motion short film** funded by the **Paulo Gustavo Audiovisual Grant (2023)** and produced in 2024 through the **Fundação Cultural de Balneário Camboriú**, in partnership with the **Ministério da Cultura** and the **Federal Government of Brazil**.

### Synopsis
In a city overwhelmed by neglect, an extremely famous yet toxic soft drink brand is discarded along with the urban waste. When the beverage comes into contact with the accumulated trash, it mutates into grotesque monsters that begin attacking and devouring people, exposing the consequences of environmental negligence and unchecked consumption.

### Role & Post-Production

My role in the project involved rig removal, cleanup, and minor post-production effects for the stop-motion animation, focusing on the elimination of visible rigs, unwanted artifacts, and frame inconsistencies to ensure visual continuity and polish.

Post-production was carried out primarily using **Adobe Photoshop** and **After Effects**, following a structured, meticulous frame-by-frame workflow across **more than 4,000 frames** over **three months of continuous work**, with strong emphasis on precision, consistency, and cinematic quality standards.
