In this video, I traveled to Fukuoka, Japan, to experience the city's famous yatai street food stalls! 🍢🔥 Unlike most of Japan, where street food stalls are rare, Fukuoka is one of the few places where yatai culture is still alive and thriving.

These small, mobile stalls serve up affordable and delicious local dishes, offering one of the most authentic Japanese street food experiences you can find. So, how good is the food, and what makes these stalls so special? Join me as I explore the best yatai in Fukuoka! 🍜🥢
