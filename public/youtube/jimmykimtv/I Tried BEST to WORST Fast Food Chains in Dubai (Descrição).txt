In this video, I will visit Dubai to rank their fast food franchises from best to worst. Dubai has all the major international fast food brands, but they also have local franchises that are known to be incredibly delicious. Since all the food is halal, many of these familiar items taste quite different compared to other parts of the world.
So in this video, I’m going to try a bunch of fast food spots in Dubai and rank them from best to worst.
Watch the video to see which one comes out on top!
