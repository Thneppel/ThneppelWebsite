In this video, I’m checking into one of Tokyo’s wildest love hotels—and trust me, this place has a seriously quirky theme! If you’ve never heard of love hotels, they’re special spots in Japan where you can rent a room for a few hours or stay the night. But the real fun? Some of them go all out with crazy interiors and over-the-top props. I’ll take you on a little tour so you can see exactly what kind of unexpected surprises are waiting inside!
